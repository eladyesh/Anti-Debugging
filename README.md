# Anti-Debugging Techniques
This repository contains code examples of anti-debugging techniques for Windows applications. These techniques can be used to protect your application from reverse engineering and debugging, by making it more difficult for a user to attach a debugger and inspect your code.

Techniques included
The following techniques are included in this repository:

- IsDebuggerPresent() check: This technique checks if a debugger is attached to the process by calling the IsDebuggerPresent() function. If the function returns true, the application can exit or take other actions to avoid being debugged.

- CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent() check: This technique checks if a remote debugger is attached to the process by calling the CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent() function. If the function returns true, the application can exit or take other actions to avoid being debugged.

Anti-debugging tricks: This folder contains several examples of anti-debugging tricks, such as setting a breakpoint in the program's entry point, using software breakpoints, and modifying the process environment block (PEB).

Usage
To use these techniques in your own application, simply copy the relevant code into your source code and compile your application. You can also use a code obfuscator to make it more difficult for attackers to understand your code.

Disclaimer
Note that while these techniques can make it more difficult for attackers to reverse engineer and debug your code, they are not foolproof. An attacker with enough time and resources can still overcome these techniques and gain access to your code. Therefore, it's important to use these techniques as part of a larger security strategy, which may include code obfuscation, encryption, and other measures.
